/*A range decoder.
  This is an entropy decoder based upon \cite{Mar79}, which is itself a
   rediscovery of the FIFO arithmetic code introduced by \cite{Pas76}.
  It is very similar to arithmetic encoding, except that encoding is done with
   digits in any base, instead of with bits, and so it is faster when using
   larger bases (i.e.: a byte).
  The author claims an average waste of $\frac{1}{2}\log_b(2b)$ bits, where $b$
   is the base, longer than the theoretical optimum, but to my knowledge there
   is no published justification for this claim.
  This only seems true when using near-infinite precision arithmetic so that
   the process is carried out with no rounding errors.

  IBM (the author's employer) never sought to patent the idea, and to my
   knowledge the algorithm is unencumbered by any patents, though its
   performance is very competitive with proprietary arithmetic coding.
  The two are based on very similar ideas, however.
  An excellent description of implementation details is available at
   http://www.arturocampos.com/ac_range.html
  A recent work \cite{MNW98} which proposes several changes to arithmetic
   encoding for efficiency actually re-discovers many of the principles
   behind range encoding, and presents a good theoretical analysis of them.
