/*============================================================================ 
**	On Intel Pentium processors (especially PIII and probably P4), converting
**	from float to int is very slow. To meet the C specs, the code produced by 
**	most C compilers targeting Pentium needs to change the FPU rounding mode 
**	before the float to int conversion is performed. 
**
**	Changing the FPU rounding mode causes the FPU pipeline to be flushed. It 
**	is this flushing of the pipeline which is so slow.
**
**	Fortunately the ISO C99 specifications define the functions lrint, lrintf,
**	llrint and llrintf which fix this problem as a side effect. 
**
**	On Unix-like systems, the configure process should have detected the 
**	presence of these functions. If they weren't found we have to replace them 
**	here with a standard C cast.
*/

/*	
**	The C99 prototypes for lrint and lrintf are as follows:
**	
**		long int lrintf (float x) ;
**		long int lrint  (double x) ;
*/

/*	The presence of the required functions are detected during the configure
**	process and the values HAVE_LRINT and HAVE_LRINTF are set accordingly in
**	the config.h file.

	/*	These defines enable functionality introduced with the 1999 ISO C
	**	standard. They must be defined before the inclusion of math.h to
	**	engage them. If optimisation is enabled, these functions will be 
	**	inlined. With optimisation switched off, you have to link in the
	**	maths library using -lm.
