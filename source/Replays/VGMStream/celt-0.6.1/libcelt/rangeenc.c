/*Outputs a symbol, with a carry bit.
  If there is a potential to propagate a carry over several symbols, they are
   buffered until it can be determined whether or not an actual carry will
   occur.
  If the counter for the buffered symbols overflows, then the stream becomes
   undecodable.
  This gives a theoretical limit of a few billion symbols in a single packet on

  The alternative is to truncate the range in order to force a carry, but
