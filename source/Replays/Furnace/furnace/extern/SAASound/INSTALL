SAASound build and install notes
--------------------------------

Win32:
    - Open VS17/SAASound.sln in Visual Studio 2017
    - Select and build the Release target
    - Copy the resulting SAASound.dll from the Release folder
	  to Windows\System (or WinNT\System32 on NT/W2K/XP)
	  or alternatively simply copy it directly to the application folder
	  that requires it (e.g. for SimCoupe and SAAPlay, copy the
	  SAASound.dll to the same folder as the executable application)

Linux/Unix:
    - To build: cmake . ; make
    - To install: sudo make install
