the Amiga computer.

Instructions for installing UADE
================================

1. Read INSTALL.readme
2. Install the program globally or directly to your home directory. Do either
	./configure
   or
	./configure --user  (makes uade to be installed under ~/.uade)
3. make
4. make install (as root if installed globally, but as the user if configure
   was given --user)
