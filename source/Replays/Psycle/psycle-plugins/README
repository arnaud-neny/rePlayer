1. About PSYCLE:


PSYCLE is a free OpenSource Music Production Studio
that offers unlimited (opinions may vary) possibilites
for creating your own music in a professional way.

PSYCLE has an Old-School Tracker interface, but it
supports VST Plugins and VST Instruments in addition
to samples, to let your wildest music ideas come true.

Here some facts about Psycle:

- 64Tracks Pattern Editor
- Internal Stereo Sampler unit, that supports high quality
  stereo .wav files and .iff samples as well (more formats will eventually come)
- 60+ Native Plugins (Generators & effects), with opensource code, and open API for third-party plugins.
- VST + VSTi Host (still limited but most plugins will work fine)
- Internal .wav output
- Configurable Keyboard Layout
- .fxb loading for VST's
- Midi-In Support

and much much more...

Note:
Psycle supports VST1.0 and VST2.0 plugins, but not completely (Some plugins will not work)
Plans for supporting DXi are there, but it's not a primary work.

If you need help starting with Psycle, you can find a tutorial on our wiki site:

2. OpenSource Notes:

PSYCLE is OpenSource. This Means: Everyone who thinks that he/she is the right person/alien
for coding on PSYCLE can contact the Team of developers and ask/tell what he/she can do for
Psycle. 

Source Page is set at SourceForge site following this link:

	http://psycle.sourceforge.net


Arguru Licensed Psycle 1.0 sources as "Public Domain".
This means that the sources of Psycle can be used in whatever form you want.

This licensing applies ONLY to his sources, which day by day are less and less.


The current team preffers to enforce that psycle sources remain Free to everyone, which
means everyone can see and modify the source, but If he does it, he cannot distribute them
in a closed way. (This means, if you do so, you have to give the sources as well)

You might, on the other hand, distrubute them as your own work, specifying that it
is A DERIVED WORK FROM PSYCLE


Also, the team would appreciate that any work done over Psycle sources, are mixed back with
the current sources, which would mean that Psycle grows instead of being divided.

There are open Forums and Bug trackers in SourceForge site and in Psycledelics site
where you can contact us.  We check the Psycledelics site often.

If you need to contact specifically the developers, write an e-mail to

	[JAZ] at jaz@pastnotecut.org for that matter.


You are allowed to develop psycle Machines without any restriction
There's no SDK ready, but you can download Psycle plugins' sourcecode from
SourceForge Site (link above)

A Buzz2Psycle SDK is avaiable at the site, but it is untested.
Hint: Check M3 sources too, which are derived from a buzz plugin.

3. Development:

Psycle 1: (The only active one right now)

	1.8: Current labeled stable version. Development will follow in bugfixing and adding
			needed features which doesn't correspond to big changes.

	1.9/2.0: Current development branch. It is expected to be a big change from current
				sources, separating them on different libs, and moving to other toolkits.


For up to date information, don't forget to visit the Developement forums on Psycledelics
site. For further info, read the HACKING file.
