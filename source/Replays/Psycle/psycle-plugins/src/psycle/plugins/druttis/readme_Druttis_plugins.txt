Installation
------------
place ALL dll's to your Psycle\Plugins\Druttis directory.



FeedMe, Phantom & PluckedString
-------------------------------
Now supports 64 channels.
Also fixed Phantoms phase & chorus lfo's that produced clicks sometimes.



Koruz
-----
First official release.
Added 4 params since 0.75 beta :
1 Phase and 1 Swirl param. for each effect part.
Phase is phase distance between left & right.
Swirl is lfo speed difference between left & right.
Koruz is NOT compatible with the 0.75 beta release,
it wont kill your speakers and it wont give you a
heart attack, but it wont sound the same cause of
parameter reordering.



Sublime
-------
First official release.
Changes since pre-release :
Increased max values for many of the parameters such
as the MOD, LFO amount and MOD, VCF, VCA time releated params.



blwtbl.dll
----------
This is a uitlity library used by the plugins ; it's not a plugin itself.
By time it'll be added with more waveforms.



Feature
-------
Most likely, there will be no further updates to FeedMe.
Instead I am going to rebuild it from scratch and add a
couple of extra functionality to it. The project name will
be MataMig ( FeedMe in Swedish ).

Phantom will go through a major update later on, mainly to
get rid of aliasing sound.

I am waiting for psycle to allow custom machine gui before
I add new stuff to the current synths for a couple of reasons.



I hope you'll enjoy the 2 new machines! I surely enjoyed doing'em!
