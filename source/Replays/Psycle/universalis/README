platform abstraction layer library

Universalis is a library which abstracts the few platform specificities
which are not handled by the boost and glibmm libraries themselves.

Those abstractions of platforms specificities can be categorized into:
 - tweaks for conformance with the C++ standard library
 - widespread compiler extensions to the C++ standard
 - widespread operating system features
 - widespread CPU features
