		* just increasing the version number to reflect the presence of a bug fix concerning loading of skins

	2005/06/07 18:16:55 psycle 1.7.54 (alpha) johan-boule

		* Version 1.7.54 (alpha)
		* oops, fix for bug introduced in 1.7.53 concerning midi device selection in the configuration

	2005/06/04 00:20:25  johan-boule

		* closing sourceforge bug #1087788.
		* rearranged the midi variables which had the channel
		* number appended to their names into arrays, and replaced the
		* related repetitive code with loops.

		* The interface of the registry class used to require we
		  specify the type and size of the each value we read or
		  write. I've changed it to use function overloading for types
		  like bool, all variants of int, and std::string, and to use
		  a template for other types so they just use REG_BINARY
		  (which means any type). So we can simply pass the variable
		  to load/save and its type and size are implicit ; it's less
		  error prone and looks nicer.

		  It works correctly, but i've noticed problems loading my
		  existing registry settings because some of the types used to
		  be REG_BINARY for values that should have been REG_DWORD
		  (and iirc vice-versa), and the registry class complains
		  about type missmatch. To work around it i've changed the
		  path of the "root" key to software/psycle/psycledelics-1.7
		  (it's actually determined from the values in
		  version.hpp).... the drawback is that people "loose" their
		  old settings.

	2005/05/30 05:13:43 psycle 1.7.51 (alpha) johan-boule

		* Version 1.7.51 (alpha)
		* change to let plugins find other .dll files that are in any intermediate dir between their own dir and the configured root dir for plugins

	2005/05/29 23:21:23 psycle 1.7.50 (alpha) johan-boule

		* Version 1.7.50 (alpha)
		* change to let plugins find other .dll files that are in the same dir as their own .dll
		  for example, blwtbl.dll can be put along with druttis plugins instead of psycle.exe's dir.

	2005/05/29 00:34:58  johan-boule

		* cvs $File -> $Id

	2005/05/25 20:20:35 psycle 1.7.49 (alpha) johan-boule

		* Version 1.7.49 (alpha)
		* removed scary pointer and index stuff from the directsound config
		  (the device index value in the registry can be deleted as it's not used anymore)

	2005/05/25 04:02:17 psycle 1.7.48 (alpha) johan-boule

		* Version 1.7.48 (alpha)
		* fixed bug for fingersoup's directsound driver (null GUID)

	2005/05/24 01:09:17  johan-boule

		* bug fix + special 0xff voice to send the same command to all voices

	2005/05/23 23:41:23  johan-boule

		* to be tested...
		  change that allows the player to send commands (Machine::Tick function) from any pattern track with a given channel (or "voice") number:

		  if the machine is not a vst, and if the note is a "mcm" (hmm, poor name if it's not related with midi),
		  then, the fields in the event are interpreted as <channel> <machine> <command> <parameter>.
		  for example, 1122334444, means:
		  11 is the channel (or "voice"),
		  22 is the machine,
		  33 is the command, and
		  4444 is the parameter
		  The player calls the Machine::Tick function with those values, and the instrument value set to 0.

	2005/05/18 06:55:47  johan-boule

		* releasing voskomo's blitz plugin

	2005/05/14 15:32:57  johan-boule

		* bug fix: operating_system::exceptions::translated::what() returned the address of a temporary stack object

	2005/05/12 22:18:39  johan-boule

		* increased version number for alpha release
		* includes jaz's bug fixes
		* fpu exceptions disabled in the configuration "by default" as it's only useful for crazy debugging hell

	2005/05/12 14:55:49  johan-boule

		* Added handling of fpu exceptions.
		  It's a build configuration option, so it can be disabled.
		  It only catches fpu exceptions in the machines' work functions, but this could be extended to other functions as well.
		  Each exception type is reported only once per machine it occurs, by growing the fpu exception mask.
		  "Inexact result" fpu exceptions are initially already masked.

		* Also, made exceptions which happen in machines appear not only in the lof, but also in a message box, because many people wondered why some machines were automagically set to bypassed/muted (The message box wouldn't be needed if the MFC logging window worked.)

	2005/05/01 14:10:59  jaz001

		* More Work on Sampulse (IT Filtering, improving commands, bugfixing).
		* Removed an cleaned (a bit) old sample sources (removed the never used sample layers)
		* Added a new internal machine "Note Duplicator". It just resends the Tick comand to the specificed machines
		* Some other small changes ( Changed the way interpolation is modified, and others)

	2005/04/06 04:32:03  johan-boule

		* Attempt to use boost::read_write_mutex instead of an exclusive mutex for Song's lock.
		  Curiously, it dead-locks.
		  So, i made it a build option that can be enabled/disabled in src/configuration.hpp
		  
		* The version info and the about box is modified to show what build options were used (multiline text).

	2005/04/02 21:48:37 psycle 1.7.37 (alpha) johan-boule

	Versions are composed this way since 1.7.24:
	M.m.p , where:
		- M = major version number.
		- m = minor version number:
			- if even, then it's a stable release.
			- if odd, then it's an unstable build or release candidate for next stable minor version number.
		- p = patch number:
			- if the minor version number is even (stable release), then this patch number is used for bug fixes, so, it's hopefully rarely incremented.
			- if the minor version number is odd (unstable builds), then this patch number is incremented very often, each cvs commit.

	v1.7.x
	______

	1.7.x were transitional versions, the changelog here keeps only the internal/technical details,
	and all the changes important from the point of view of the user are moved or summarized above in the v1.8 log.

	build and distribution process:
		! fix closing bug [ 1087782 ] psycle MFC's version number is spread in several places
		+ added automatized compilation + packaging + update of psycle sourceforge site for faster and more frequent updates (bohan)
		* new versionning scheme, with three numbers
		+ The version info and the about box is modified to show what build options were used (multiline text) (bohan)
		+ added cpu specific builds for 6th and 7th generation x86 CPUs (bohan)

	internal changes in the source code:
		* refactoring of the source code: cleaner internally, but no visible changes for the users (bohan & magnus)
		* rewriting of the native and vst plugin hosts with exception handling (bohan & magnus)
		* ported the open source native plugins to the new compiler (bohan)
		+ let plugins find other .dll files that are in any intermediate dir between their own dir and the configured root dir for plugins (bohan)
			plugins which need helper .dll files (like druttis' sublime), can now find it even if it's not placed in the same dir as psycle.exe ; it can be placed along with the plugin (or actually, in any "intermediate" dir). (bohan)
			note from bohan:
				i still think it would be better to simply disallow having a deep directory tree of libraries and rather put them all, flat, in the same dir.
				it would be a lot simpler, and even have some technical advantages: what if a plugin depends on other plugins for example?
		* attempt to use boost::read_write_mutex instead of an exclusive mutex for Song's lock. (bohan, doesn't work, dead locks)
		+ added optional (masked otherwise) handling of fpu exceptions (bohan)
		! rearranged the midi code ; closing sourceforge bug #1087788 (bohan)
		* interface of the registry class more "c++ oriented" (if that term exist ;p) and independent from the winapi (bohan)
		* Importing configuration from older psycle's and psycle alpha (jaz)
		- removing unimplemented alk's mixer (jaz)

	bugfixes:
		! bug fix with psycle::Machine::GetNumParams() and its redefinition in derived classes (the bug only existed in previous 1.7.x versions). (bohan)
		+ added special handling of labels in the machine parameter combo box for native plugins (bohan)
		! fixed bug for fingersoup's directsound driver (null GUID) and removed scary pointer and index stuff from the directsound config (bohan)
		! fix bugs with Note Duplicator (load/save and deadlock). (jaz)
		! fix bug with render to wav, where in some specific situations where playing some instruments incorrectly. (jaz)
		! closes bug: sourceforge bug tracker [ 1229490 ] Velocity / volume data with MIDI keyboard (jaz & bohan)
		! fixed small but in "recent files" (jaz)
		* comments about unfinished features (jaz)

	!back in 1998, you were using mswin98, and nowadays? ... hmm, shame on you, but psycle still works on it. (alk & bohan)


	v1.7.6.1
	--------

	!fixed OLD bug, VSTi data slider would send data to the VSTi whenever the slider was repainted, if tweak record is enabled then the data gets written to the pattern (alk)

	v1.7.6
	------

	!fixed bug, master volume does not release focus! (alk)
	!realigned widgets and controls so they are neater ;) (alk)

	+pattern step now affects navigation (alk)
	+swing fill defaults are nicer :) (alk)

	v1.66
	-----

	+ Added elapsed playtime (by KooPer)
	+ Now loading songs with machines outside of the screen moves them to a visible area.
	+ VST host correctly does "idle" calls to VST's now. This supposedly makes AbSynth work.
	+ VST host now replies to "GetParameterQuantization". Some plugins use this to round correctly.
	+ Added Patch to make VSTi sc-101 from SC developers work. (Not an awesome plugin anyway, and crashes)
	+ New machine graphics thanks to /\/\ark.
	+ Added four colour themes selectable via a comboox in configuration-settings, "visual" folder.
	* Important change in the Song Loading routine to load better the VST Plugins.
	  Also, now saves the program number, so VST's like "Triangle II", "Vivaldi" and "Ganymed" work!
	  New Files wont load VST's in previous versions of Psycle. It's sort of a security for newer files.
	* Changed the sequencer a bit:
	  Now only shows the patterns within the sequence length. (Following a request made some time ago)
	  Added "add 10" and "dec 10" to pattern position (This will make some happy too)
	  Now Insert inserts after the current position (previously, it was before).
	  "Next Pattern" keyboard key now auto inserts new pattern when reaching the end.
	  Removed "setLen", since now it is a bit useless.
	  Removed "Spread" and replaced by "Sort patterns".
	* Changed Wav loading routines to use RIFF loader. This allows to see SoundForge's loops settings.
	* Pattern editor now hides the "0000" value in effects column (when it is not used as twk or mcm)
	* Cleaned up a bit the Instrument editor Dialog (No new functionality yet) and fixed little errors in the envelopes editor.
	! Fixed several problems with VST's and presets. (pooplog made changes to allow his plugins to
	  save extra data, but he didn't realize that VST's do save in .prs format too)
	! Fixed that annoying "param increased by 1" bug with some VST's. ( int(intvar-b) != intvar-(int)b )
	! Fixed Wave editor Pasting but where pasting to an empty slot overwrote the previous instrument.
	! Fixed a crash when deleting a machine and playing back (removed bug from all possible places)
	! Fixed Sampler Retrig Command. (Now it really behaves like it should)
	! Fixed Native machines window now correctly shown in windows XP/nonstandard-titlebar-sizes.
	! Fixed Instrument editor. Changing Instrument number with arrows didn't update the main combobox.
	  Also, now it shows in HEX, to be like the combobox.
	! Fixed a cause for crash when loading songs/closing Psycle. (paint updating while deleting song)
	! Fixed : Flanger Machine could become unstable and use all the CPU avaiable when
			  the feedback was higher than 50% and the input sound stopped.
	! Fixed : Loading bug that causes volumes to be damaged between native<->VST<->native connections.
	          Generally, you won't notice it, but the file is damaged (meaning, not complying to what
			  there should be in the file). The saving routine has been fixed and the loader routine
			  has been modified to be aware of this problem.
	! Fixed : Loading a sample with a name longer than 32chars, activated the "Tempo Syncronized Loop"
	! Fixed : Rare "divide by zero" error at startup fixed ( thanks to Gulrak for this )
	! Fixed : Doubleclicking over "mute" "solo" or "bypass" machine buttons now acts like two single clicks
	! Fixed : Rightclicking the mouse (to show the popup menu) moved the cursor. Fixed. (Why did I move it?)


	V1.6plus
	--------
	+ Added: Enter Key now Selects the Machine and Instrument under the cursor.
	+ Added: Loop Setting in wave Editor. Ctrl+Left Click = Start . Ctrl+Rigth Click = End.
	+ Added: Right Clicking in the Wave Ed does Zoom in if selection and Zoom Out if no selection.
	+ Added: Added shortcut Ctrl+P to show up the Presets dialog.
	+ Added: Sampler Retrig Command ( 15xy )
	+ Added: Saving a song now also adds it to the recent songs Popup.
	+ Added: New compiled M3, AS2f and JMDrum Machines.
	  M3: ported again (and better?)
	  AS2f: Random mode made like ABass (noise)
	  JMDrum : Some voice allocation changes (no more crashes?)
	+ Added: New "toy" : PluckedString.dll from Druttis
	* Change: Parameter windows now are showed centered on the screen.
	* Change: Machine box created also centered on the mouse
	* Change: WaveEd shortcutkey for amplify is now Ctrl+M and Ctrl+A is select all (Del is Delete)
	* Change: Now the "autosave.psy"'s are created ALWAYS on your songs Root Directory.
	* Change: Due to a previous fix, you couldn't change the BPM nor the TPB when a song was playing.
	  now this is possible again.
	* Change: To select a machine in the Machine view now you have to press Control Key. Previus method
	  used to cause troubles when tweaking effects.
	! bug: Sequence selection was not correcly updated when stopping sometimes.
	! bug: Note entering with MIDI keyboards didn't enter the velocity as previous versions did.

	V1.6
	----
	+ Added Song Autosave. Each 10 minutes, a file named "autosave.psy" is saved with your current data.
	+ Added a confirmation dialog when pressing the Save Button. (As it seems, some people press it by mistake)
	+ Added : "Arguru Bass", "Arguru Synth", "Arguru Synth 2" and "ASynth21" are replaced by "Argury Synth 2f"
	  when loading songs that used those old plugins.
	+ Added Dll Name in the "New Machine" dialog and posibility to show Dll name instead of name.
	+ Added : Now machine Dialogs' title indicate the machine number too.
	+ Added Feature: Clicking on a machine selects it in the combobox.
	+ Added : Option in Master Dialog to autoDecrease Master volume when clipping
	  (Note: like all other machine's _dialog_ boxes, the slidebar is not updated till you reopen it)
	+ Added "Shift+Mouse Move" to move the knobs of parameters in steps of 1.
	+ Added back Space Bar -> Stop Song. To enable it, go to Keyboard Configuration and Make sure
	  that the checkbox named "Right CTRL stop / Space play" is active.
	+ Shift+Note (add note and jump to the next track) works again. Also, modified Pattern Step 0
	  to do this as well.
	+ Added Feature: Player now remembers the last machine used in each track.
	+ Added Mcm Command. Replaces the VST's 10xx Command which did the same thing.
	- twf Command removed. Now you can do the same with the twk command (old songs will STILL show
	  twf).
	- Removed code that makes a sampler machine change the polyphony to 8 when loading a song
	  where it is 2. This was needed for old (<1.1) songs.
	* GUI Improved: Little placement changes, new combobox and a new internal logic to update
	  automatically these comboboxes when needed.
	* Set "Use Gfx Double buffer" On by default (It has been proved enough, and it's better)
	* Changed : Effect Machines are now numbered from 40(hex) to 7F(hex)
	* CTRL+X does not Unselect now.
	* Doubleclick on the sequencer now sets that position to the first not used pattern.
	* "Insert" on the sequencer now inserts the first not used in that position and increases Length.
	* Little changes in the Native Machine interface made by pooplog. This improves the visuals.
	* Changes in the MachineInterface.h definition file. (made by pooplog)
	  This causes all older machines to cease function.This concretely means that M3, AS2.1 and Guru6
	  work no more (They were considered "Old/buggy" machines anyway).
	  Note: We have the sources of the M3 Buzz machine, so soon we will have a Psycle version of it again.
	* New Machine Dialog (Plugin Browser) now supports up to 512 Plugins (256 was the limit before)
	* Changed the function which obtains the name of the VST plugins. You should Refresh the machine list.
	  (thanks to Destroy FX ( http://www.smartelectronix.com/~destroyfx ) for making us notice this)
	  Note: ZR-1 shows up as "flp" (which was the old name).
	* Modified also the way to get the Version Number. Most of the time you will get "0" now. Don't
	  know what is worse...
	* Playing engine Changes. Now it executes tracker (Fxxx) and twk/Mcm commands before than notes.
	* Set default Amplitude for sampler to Minimum (So that it acts like being disabled)
	! Fixed: Starting Psycle, needed to swap to the pattern view to have MIDI In working.
	! Fixed crash while playing MIDI and then loading a song.
	! Fixed crash when loading an invalid (non existant) wave file.
	! Fixed bug where you could no longer play samples if you loaded a sample and pressed OK/Cancel
	  while it was still playing (prelistening) (Reported by alk)
	! Fixed some playback Issues with the sampler in other sampleRate than 44100Hz
	! Fixed the "New Machine" dialog resetting to "Sort by Type" each time.
	! Fixed tweaks in some Internal Machines not working as expected.
	! Fixed bug(crash, sometimes) when delete unexistent machine (dummy machine which came from loading
	  a song and having a .dll missing) Entry on generators was not removed.
	! Fixed "Arguru Synth"(all versions) not Stopping/noteoff right when using arpeggio.
	! Fixed VST Flickering ocurring when a song was tweaking a _native_ plugin.
	! Fixed: selecting a group of patterns in the sequencer and "playblock" looped at songlength
	  if this was previous to the block end.
	! Fixed Crash bug when not indicating the wire Index with the FCxx command
	! F8 Should now Stop all notes started in the pattern.
	  (EXCLUDING those started by MIDI commands if the plugin doesn't support "all notes off" event)
	! Chords with VSTi's didn't work well if you did like : F-4 | A-4 | C-5  and in the next lines
	  A-4 | C-5 | E-5 . It will STILL not work if you do: F-4 | A-4 | C-5 and A-4 | off | off.
	  Can't fix it completely without recoding.
	! Fixed bug: Entering "twk" or "twf" command in the pattern was innecessary executed.
	  This could have caused many parameters to get changed without notice.
	! Fixed graphical bug in selection where "ctrl+b , ctrl+e and Tab" sequence was made at the end
	  of the pattern. (Wrong variable used).
	! Fixed "Tracks" Combobox not being updated on open/import/new file.
	! Fixed Scrolling bug. Shift+Tab on the first Track and pressing play showed that the "row" numbers
	  got overwritten.
	! Fixed Double Buffered Screen Resize problem (It really didn't resize)
	! Fixed ENORMOUS GUI bug in the pattern editor when you used FExx command to change the TPB.
	  Bugfix has consisted on changing the value only in the Player, not in the song.



	V1.6RC4
	-------

	* Dropped new Stop for VST's and put back the old one. (was worse, since not all plugs implement it)
	+ Added pattern MIDI Command for VST's. Please, check "Tweakings and commands.txt" for more info.
	! Fixed the value showed for filter sustain (showed up to 127%)
	* Put default Attack value (in synthesis) to 0.02ms. (almost 0) (phongshade asked for this)


	V1.6RC3
	-------

	Dropped source of 1.6RC2. Took from V1.6RC1

	+ Fixed all bugs and added all the features of RC2
	! Fixed a bug in finetune loading in XM importing (thanks Bohan)
	! Psycle no more crashes when you accidentally make a loop with machines (like: A->B->C->A).
	  It will IGNORE the loop. (Better approach would be don't let the user do so)
	! Fixed some little bugs with the Scrollbars being incorrectly activated/deactivated.
	* Space bar now doesn't stop the song.
	+ Added MIDI channel support for VSTi's. Use the AUX/Inst colum to indicate the MIDI channel,
	  starting from 0 to F. Nothing means channel 0.
	! VST's now send "All notes off" message when "Stop". This should fix some rare cases where notes
	  didn't stop.
	+ Added ShortCut keys to VST Editor (CTRL+R , Randomize parameters)
	+ Added ShortCut keys to Wave Editor.


	V1.6RC2
	-------

	+ Added option to don't show the about dialog on psycle startup.
	+ New nice Graphics thanks to frown!

	! Fixed bug with FFxx FExx FCxx and F8xx commands, which DELETED themselves after being played.
	  (Sorry, a wrong approach for a tiny detail)
	! Fixed Pattern editor bug when resizing Psycle (well.. I never do that).
	! Fixed Pattern editor selection "bug", where you could select past the end of the pattern.
	! Dll's are now removed from the Name Cache if they are no longer valid.
	! Manually changed Directories in the configuration, weren't saved.(I didn't completely fix this)
	! Fixed still another crash bug in the wave editor, when cutting and the end.
	  (more signed-unsigned problems, which weren't reported as warnings this time)
	! Playing notes from a VST dialog didn't stop the notes if it wasn't the machine selected in
	  the combobox of Generators (in psycle main screen). Fixed.


	V1.6RC1
	-------

	* Wave Editor
	  * Changed zooming criteria
	  ! Fixed crash while editing (modifying) samples being played.
	  ! Fixed a crash bug when zooming at the very beginning of a sample (Reported by sampler)
	  ! Fixed selection bug when mouse went over the left side.
	  ! Removed all the compiler warnigs (one of them caused the previous error)

	* Pattern Editor
	  * Changed shift+left/right(cursor selection) to jump a track instead of a column. (asked by sampler)
	  * Added again the "unselect when cursor moving" option (Asked by sampler)
	    ADVISE: If "Shift+Arrows Do Selection" is activated, you won't be able to select with
	    CTRL+B CTRL+E keys.
	  + Added Home/End/Prior/Next to selection keys. (Shift+Home = select to top) (Asked by sampler)
	  + Added "Cursor Always Down" Checkbox, which makes the cursor behave like the older Psycle versions.
	    If it is deactivated, it acts like ModPlug/IT, where cursor moves right in Gens/instr/Fx columns
	  - Removed feature which made pattern go back to the starting one when stopping playback and
	    "follow song" was active. It used to cause confusion.
	  ! Graphic bug: Enabling follow song didn't refresh the pattern properly.
	  ! Graphic bug where scrolling up/down made the cursor move (This was entered as a side effect of
	    a new feature)
	  ! Graphic bug: When selecting and moving the mouse out of the pattern (to scroll), it
	    showed a wrong selection (usually everything selected from that track to left). This might have
	    caused other graphical bugs, since a variable was changed to an incorrect value.
	    (Reported by Kris)
	  ! Fixed pattern changing when having follow song selected and going to Machine view and back.
	  ! Fixed bug: Changing generator with keyboard didn't refresh the Pars/Waves combobox.(Rep. by sampler)

	+ Added Graphics Double Buffering (No flicker). You should enable it in the configuration Dialog.
	  Note: This is just a temporary double buffer. The code should be optimized.
	+ Added a spin edit in VST parameters dialog, to change the program. (asked by Athl0nXP)

	+ Added (FINALLY!!) Name Caching for Plugins (both native and VST) for fast Psycle loading times.

	! Fixed Noise with Flanger Effect at high speeds (mainly everything higher than 1/4th)
	  Note: CPU usage increased by a factor of 1.5 and RAM usage decreased (no relation within them).
	  Note2: Used some code from http://www.smartelectronix.com/musicdsp for FAST sine calculation
	! Fixed (possible) Crash bug when specifying a machine number bigger than 40 (hex). This even
	  prevented from being able to change wire volume (FCxx) for effects. (Reported by Pikari)
	! Fixed bug: Wave editor amplify changed only the left channel on stereo wavs (Reported by Kris)
	! Fixed bug: Sampler new "smooth volume change" was a bit faulty (not initialized properly).
	  (Reported by Pikari)

	  BTW: Thanks to beta testers for finding bugs in the new things I added/fixed.

	+ More work done by Fideloop on the Wave Editor. Here's a few:
	  + Added Clipboard cut/copy/paste support
	  + Added Sample Reversion, Convert to mono and Adjust volume.
	  * Modified a bit the visual layout
	  * Recoded the internals.

	* Reverted to previous way of selection (whole column). It's alot easier to work with.
	* Various little fixes and improvements in the pattern input.
	* Very little change in the combobox behaviour in the VST parameters editor.

	! Various memory and resource leaks fixed (hopefully! Hard work done towards it!)
	! Fixed pattern editor bugs related to Scrollbars (not scrolling properly). This might have
	  caused other graphical bugs as well.
	! Fixed CPU meter for VSTi's ( "=" , "+=" ...)
	! Fixed "click" in fast volume changes with the Sampler.


	V1.6b3b
	-------
	! Corrected serious XM import transpose bug
	! Wave loader bugfixes
	  * faster
	  * loads 24 bit WAV
	  * loads WAV with PAD chunk
	! Fixed sampler default "resampling = linear" omission
	! Fixed CPU performance again. (Still has a bit of multitasking effect, but works)
	! Cancel in Presets Dialog didn't cancelled (wondering how I did the code...)

	V1.6b3 (mainly bugfix)
	----------------------

	+ Preliminary XM Import
	  Advise: It transposes the notes in the pattern so that the samples are played acordingly
	 * Still todo: 
	  * volume/pan envelope translation
	  * dedicated volume effect channel
	  * multi-sample instruments
	  * lots of unsupported XM commands - esp. tempo change

	* Partial Internal-plugins rebuild.
	  - Tweaks don't go out of the range now.
	  - You can indicate negative values adding 8000  (8004 = -4)

	+ Waves' combobox now show parameters when a non-Sampler machine is selected.
	  (addition thanks to the previous change)
	+ twk twf commands now automatically add the parameter number (IF a valid machine is selected).
	+ 2pFilter now display its units. Note: Frequency indicator might not be accurate.
	+ Colours are saved now.
	+ "Reset Default Colours" button added to Configuration.

	* Changed Sampler Default Resampling to "Linear".
	* Changed CPU performance logic a big. ("Routing" is real now. "Total" is weird sometimes(Multitasking effect))
	* Master Machine now uses around 25% less CPU time. (Removed non important calcs from loop)

	- Moving the cursor automatically unselected the marked block. This made selection with
	  "CTRL+B/CTRL+E" impossible so now this is removed.

	! Fixed bug where Vertical Scrollbar had invalid values (one more position than the real))
	! Fixed bug when changing number of tracks/patternlines didn't update correctly.
	! Doubleclicking to create a machine does create it on the clicked position again (not randomly).
	! Fixed WrapAround/centerCursor being always on/off after Restart. (Reported by alk)
	! Fixed "save" Dialog not appearing when song had \ / | : * " < or > in the Songname.
	! Fixed changing directories in Configuration needed of a restart of psycle. Now it doesn't.
	! Fixed one graphical bug in Machine view (panning to incorrect values. Reported by Tecknocide)
	! Fixed two graphical bugs with Playing cursor. (Not being resized properly and not dissapearing)
	! Fixed bug. Pressing CTRL+A/B/C/D/E/F over a non-note column caused the letter to be inserted instead
	  of the command being executed (when in editmode).
	! Fixed a bug(?) where some wire volumes could change after saving a song (at least theoretically)
	! Fixed bug. Selecting with CTRL+B/CTRL+E (and also with CTRL+A and CTRL+R) didn't work. (Rep. Gerwin)
	! Fixed bug. Pasting a whole pattern (CTRL+F5) didn't update the number of rows. (Rep. Gerwin)


	V1.6b2
	------
	* NEW PATTERN EDITOR (lot of new code!!!)
	 * Faaaaaaster! (it flickers and it's a bit buggy. I will add a Double buffer to fix it after)
	 + ScrollBars!!! They behave a bit different from usual windows. Waiting for oppinions.
	 + CenterCursor Feature can be disabled.
	 + Option: Shift+Arrows can be used for selection
	 + Option: Delete behaviour configurable between FT2/IT
	 + Colours are Configurable. (Note: they are not saved yet!)
	 - Muted Columns are not displayed in a different colour now (this made the code a bit simplier)
	 + Selection allows to select a single element (ex: note).
	   Note: functions are not converted yet, so it is quite useless.

	* New Wave Editor From Fideloop. (He is still improving it further)

	* Generators and instruments are shown in hex numbers now. (To easily write them
	  to the pattern)
	! You cannot put machines out of the screen now.(Reported by ADVANZE)
	! Select Column/Select all caused a crash when copying. (Reported by |SOLARIS|)
	! -0.1db Vol. bug (Reported by Pikari)
	! Fixed a VST display bug when opening the dialog (Reported by cubic Elements)



	V1.6b1
	------
	Thanks to Dan (our newest coder) for most of this:

	+ Configurable InputHandler class to handle input events (accessible from Global::)
	  This means now you can Configure the Hotkeys of nearly all actions.
	  ADVISE! Some keys have changed!
	+ Save/loadable key config, uses %windowsdir%\psyclekeys.ini
	+ Can now audition notes in FX dialogs AND in machine view!
	+ FT2 style 'edit' mode toggle.
	+ FT2 style multi-channel audition, now usable as a live audio source (toggleable)
	+ Added keyboard commands for some more things (eg. note skip inc/dec, block unmark..)
	+ MIDI input now velocity sensitive (CMidiInput::fnMidiCallback_Step, CChildView::MidiPatternNote)
	+ MIDI input now records velocity sensitive data using 0Cxx command
	+ MIDI behaviour now toggleable between audition mode/sequencer mode from Config menu
	+ MIDI note-off record now toggleable from Config menu
	+ Toggle for FT2/IT style home/end behaviour in Keyboard Config
	+ Toggle for Right CTRL to Play in Keyboard Config (seems not to work on all keybs)
	+ Added .fxb Loading(if same name than plugin .dll) and importing.
	  This will become the default preset format for VST's in next versions.
	  Thanks to Frederic (reflex) for info on fileformat.
	+ Pasting now moves the cursor downwards.

	- Removed keyboard selection menu - to be replaced with custom INI files ASAP

	* Cleanups/fixes to KeyUp and KeyDown events in many places
	* keybdhandler code changed to use InputHandler
	* MIDI changed to use InputHandler
	* CMainFrame::Psybar2Init cleanups

	! Key skip and page up/down now cycle past end/start of pattern properly
	! Fixed crashing bug in CChildView::DrawMachine if invalid machine
	! Fixed crashing bug in CMainFrame::UpdatePlayOrder if editposition out of range
	! Fixed crashing bug in CMainFrame::OnSelchangeSeqList if editposition out of range
	! Fixed a bug in Importing presets where sometimes it associated a preset with the wrong name.
	! Fixed a visual bug in Parameters' dialogs in previous version (affecting especially VST's).
	! Fixed a crash when loading VST machines that had a name longer than 32 chars.(now limited to 64)
	! Fixed a tiny bug where a bypassed machine didn't have the switch "bypass" activated.
	! When two machines were overlapped, trying to move the topmost, moved the bottommost.


	V1.5b3r5
	--------
	+ Added "Random Parameters" to VST's as a request of an user.
	+ Added Command 0Cxx to VST's (Set volume). Only works in noteon right now.
	+ Added VST Chunk Saving. (Not tested, but should work).

	! Saving a Preset with an existing name corrupted the file. Fixed.
	! Importing didn't saved to the file. Fixed.
	! Volumes between VST's and other Machines were loaded at MAX value ALWAYS. Fixed (thanks ksn)
	! Fixed a few bugs on the German Keyb Setting
	! Finally fixed the loss of focus (not able to play) in the VST Params Dialog when 
	  changing parameters/Program.
	! Fixed once more, and for all, the Loading/Saving of Blocks.


	V1.5b3+
	-------

	+ Added IFF loader (thanks to krokpitr for info about the fileformat)
	+ Two new Global Commands that allow to do Three (yes, three) new actions: Machine panning,
	  global volume and Wire volume. check the "Tweaking and commands" file for details.

	* Made Tempo sincronized editbox (In instruments dialog) AutoHScroll. An user reported that
	  he couldn't add more than two digits. This should fix that.

	! "Missing VST plugin" message didn't show the Plugin Name.
	! It also didn't skip the parameters' values, so most of the time it chashed after this.
	! Sampler noteoff didn't worked. I added code not to start a note if no valid instrument was
	  selected, but I put it previous to noteoff check.
	! "Couldn't open file" error message appeared when opening the presets dialog of a machine that
	  had no presets. This error wouldn't have to be reported.


	V1.5b3
	------
	* MIDI Improved in many ways:
	  + Added Sync codes so that you can use Psycle in conjuntion with other Soft/Hardware Synths
	    controlled by a sequencer.
	  + MIDI monitor Added. Just to know what is happening.
	  + Note Entering in pattern using a MIDI keyboard now Possible (basic.Better in newer versions)
	  - Removed MIDI support when using DirectSound. Directsound routines need to be updated.

	* VST's
	  * NEW host based on Arguru's Aodix/Freebase one! (implemented really different)
	    Still basic, but more plugins work now (reported A lot more)
		Warning: Mono VST effects (like DB Compressor) will output a mono signal. (before they
		processed only the left channel)
	  * Now allows for multinote on the same pattern row (This doesn't work on all VSTi's)
	  * Changed Parameters' Editor, hope it is nicer now.!!Reported to crash with some plugins!!
	  + Added Native Psycle gui to VST's that don't have Gui.
	  ! Now, the sliders (and gui) are updated when selecting a preset.

	* Native Plugins
	  * Changed partially the Loading implementation, made it similar to the new VST implementation.
	  ! Found & Fixed the Memory leak! dlls were unloaded from memory, but not the machines themselves.
	  * Also, now the dll's are unloaded from memory after psycle's startup.
	    Thanks to these two things, Psycle now uses a lot less RAM!
	  * Arguru Synth 2f comes to replace all other AS's (Also ABass). Its Glide is different from
	    the one in AS2.2, but a formula to convert to the new one is provided.

	* New Machine Dialog
	  + Added Nice icons to identify Plugins! (Waiting for better ones from alk)
	  + Added Support for Subdirectories

	* Source Code Cleanup. Removed unused files and made the Splash smaller (256color paletted)
	  This is the main reason of the filesize decrease.

	+ Added RealTime Note Entering (for both, PC and MIDI keyboards). You'll need to activate
	  "follow song" in the Sequencer (and press play, of course).
	+ Added another keyshortcut: Shift+Enter Pops Up the Selected Machine's Parameters.
	+ Machine Soloing Now Implemented.
	+ Presets IMPORT/EXPORT added (finally!)
	  Note: you can only export one preset at a time, but you can specify the same file, so that
	  they are appended.
	+ German Keyboard added.
	  Note: I will not add any other one. It is planned to allow keyboard mapping from the
	  Configuration in the next version.

	! Incorrect sample finetune loading bug fixed!
	  (This affected an old great song from Gerwin: ThreeTimesBU.psy)
	! F6 (play sequence block) didn't worked.. fixed.
	! Pressing CTRL+Del removed the first line of the following pattern. fixed.
	! Some (most of the) dialogs had wrong TAB order. Now fixed
	! Fixed a little bug in the load/save block (It didn't save what was supposed to be saved)



	V1.5b2
	------
	+ _MIDI_ in Support added thanks to Mark McCormark!! Read the file "Psycle Midi.doc" for Info.
	+ _Presets_ support Added (only Native Plugins and VST's by now);
	+ Added Posibility to play a sequence Block (like play a single pattern,for example)
	  Note: you _can_ select non consecutive patterns (Use CTRL+Click)
	  Fast Selection: Drag.
	+ Follow pattern now also updates the current pattern
	  Other optimizations in the Follow song feature (return to previous seq. position,etc..)
	+ Added Right Click Popup Menu in the Pattern Editor (cut/copy/paste/interpolate...)
	  (I know it doesn't appear correctly sometimes... I would need to check screen size, popup size
	  and mouse position and I don't do it)
	+ Made changes in the "New Machine" dialog to show "Internal,Native,Vst" or "Generator/Effects"
	+ Added Machine Stopping when Idle. It stops a machine that has not produced sound the last
	  time it has been called. Activate it when editing or previewing to turn down the CPU usage.
	  Note: Some machines don't respond properly in this mode (specifically delayed ones).
	+ Added Bypass!!! (You can click on the little button on the machine. The same for Mute)
	+ Added FineTweak of Parameters. Hold the Control key for a 10x finer tweak.
	+ Added a bunch of new Key Shorcuts. SOME OF THEM HAVE CHANGED. Take a look at the new keys.txt
	  CTRL+Q and CTRL+A are NOT inverted with french keyb now. Don't know what is better...
	+ Entering numbers with the Numpad is possible now.
	+ Added Option (not) to wrap the cursor around in the Pattern Editor.
	+ Save option added (save without asking the name)
	+ Sample Preview works again! Select the wave file to hear it.(Asked many times)
	+ "Kill" button in the Instruments Editor works now. (i.e. Deletes that instrument)
	+ MANY GUI changes. Some of them (like the new Splash) thanks to bunny. More to come. :·)

	- Removed changing the selected instrument/Generator with the combobox (Most of the time
	  users changed it accidentally)

	* Sampler:
	  + Added PortaUp(01xx), PortaDown(02xx) (both Linear), Panning(08xx), NoteCut in x frames(0ECx)
	    and NoteDelay in x frames(0EDx)
	  + Removed NoteOff in x frames (yyCx) I think nobody knew it anyway.
	  ! Fixed Volume command (0Cxx) Now works also if there's no note.
	  IMPORTANT! Don't forget that in Psycle you need to indicate the Generator Number also.
	* Loading and saving of block now use the internal clipboard. This means you will have to copy
	  the block before saving, and pasting the block where you want after loading.
	* Edit Quantize = 0 Now moves the cursor to the next row in track (i.e. like writing)

	! Wav Writting bugs (Clipping and Wrong content being written) fixed.
	! FIXED Psycle losing focus when closing Machines' parameters in some cases.
	  (It was not a bug but a wrong window creating option choosed!)
	! Fixed crash when loading a song with missing VST's and another one when unloading.
	! Playback of notes in the Machine View now don't repeat the note while keypressed.
	! CTRL+F3 (pattern cut) didn't copied the pattern properly.
	! CTRL+DEL (delete one row) added FFFF in the command/parameter column and deleted first
	  entry. Fixed.
	! _Some_ of the gui faults (being not drawn completely) fixed.
	! A few problems with the focus being kept by the sequencer have been fixed
	! Fixed lost of directory when loading samples (the same bug again, but in a different place)
	! Machine Panning was not properly initialized when loading a song. Fixed.
	! TPB and BPM are now updated when changed in pattern (FFxx and FExx commands)


	Note: There's a serious memory leak (at least since 1.1b2) in the loading/unloading function
		  (most probably a bad destruction of machines).
		  Don't load many(5~10) songs per session or psycle will eat your resources.
		  This bug won't be fixed for 1.5betas, but maybe I'll look at it in newer 1.x ones.


	V1.5b1+ (bugfix!)
	-----------------

	+ Added parameter numbering to the internal Effects (I forgot that, sorry)
	+ Block Transpose Added. Use CTRL+Q to move upwards and CTRL+A downwards
	  (if french keyb conf is used, then CTRL+Q is downwards and CTRL+A upwards)
	  (well.. It was added in V1.5b1, but I forgot to add it in the whatsnew)


	! !!!!___Changed TPB command from FDxx to FExx___!!!! (Mistaken internally)

	! Fixed bug where setting FF00/FD00 crashed psycle
	! Fixed bug where also using twk/twf and FFxx/FDxx, the tempo/TPB was changed
	! Interpolation now iterpolates the full command/parameter row, not only the parameter part.
	! Now trully fixed the lost of directory when loading (I fixed it when saving, but for some
	  reason I didn't for loading)

	Ps. Yes.. Commands for the Sampler will be in the next beta.
	Ps2. The key for the "twf" command is the same than the "twk", but pressing Shift


	V1.5b1
	------

	+ "twf" command added and slightly changed the Generators Bar. This allow tweaking
	  effects in the same way you do with the twk command.
	+ Note playback on Machine View! This allows to play notes while tweaking the
	  machines.
	  _Known bug_: on VSTi's, notes are played only if you don't select anything.
	  This means that you can only play&tweak on Graphical VSTi's.
	  (trick for long sounds : play the note and, just after that, click on the machine title
	  bar. weird but works)
	+ Mouse support (Cursor positioning and block selecting) Mute still avaiable
	  clicking on the header of the tracks (clicking over the M or the red light)
	+ Track Soloing (Clicking over S or the green light). When Unsoloing, it unmutes ALL
	  tracks. If you find it problematic, I will add more code to unmute only those
	  that where muted when soloing that track.
	+ Added Interpolation of command parameters. The Key is CTRL+I" (select a block with the
	  mouse then CTRL+I)
	+ Tempo and TPB pattern commands added. They are FFxx and FExx respectively
	  Known bugs: They don't update the display and remain changed after stopping.
	  It will be fixed in next version.
	+ ".psy" extension is added automatically when saving.
	+ Added posibility to change the Generator/Instrument of the Selected Block.
	  Select a block and change it using the _Combobox_.
	  (a Rightclick Popup menu will be added in next version)
	+ Added < > to change the Generator. Right now it only works on a spanish keyboard
	  It will change in the future.. I hope you can wait.
	  If you have a block selected, then they will change it on the Block.
	+ Added the missing code to the "Dec" and "Clear" buttons in the Sequencer.
	+ Added Block Saving as a Request of Gerwin. Saves the selected block to a file

	! Crash when showing the properties dialog (the one showed when right clicking) of
	  machines with a name longer than 15 chars (ex: VB-1 Virtual Instrument)
	! Patched (not fixed, but at least doesn't crash) the crash bug when loading
	  (in fact, when unloading) some psycle songs that use VST's.
	  Note: There are other (less frequent) crashes not related to this one that
	  are not fixed.
	! Fixed strange crash with some old songs (1.1b1?) that had a wrong TPB (thanks bunny)
	! Fixed bug where Parameters of machines weren't shown if the total number wasn't
	  divisible by the number of columns. (Example: Arguru Bass HAD Volume parameter)
	! Fixed (I hope) a loss of the current directory after loading or saving songs.
	! Changes in the "NewValue" Dialog (the one that lets you specify the value of a
	  machine parameter).
	  -Title changed so that it is shown completely.
	  -Editbox Changed, gets activated and text is selected when it's shown. Also, allows
	   adding the minus "-" sign. (also letters, but it ignores them)
	  -Also fixed: Cancel didn't cancelled (Values were changed)
	! Fixed the Machine moving bug when the Machine frame got the focus after some
	  operations (example:clicking a machine, clicking the arrow of a combobox and
	  clicking over the machine view again)
	! Instrument change with the arrows correctly changes the instrument in the
	  instrument dialog.
	! TPB correctly updated when loading a song.

	Note: This is a maintenance version. It's only aimed to make the usage
	      of the program easier and less buggy.
	      Psycle 2 is being rebuilt from the ground up to catch all the bugs
	      (specially VST's related) and make it even better.

	Note2:Yes, the interface is still quite slow...



	V1.1b2
	------
	*Reimplemented WAV recording (it automatically stops when song loops
	 and doesn't start until 'play' is clicked)
	*Changed the VST interface slightly - some machines still crash when
	 selecting the common GUI, although e.g. the Model-E works now.
	*Fixed a CPU cost calculation bug
	*Implemented "follow song" mode in sequencer
	*Added safer thread synchronization - less crashes :)
	*Initial configuration dialog should now work
	*Fixed a bunch of Load/Save bugs
	*Added "Length" value to sequencer - this shows the song's length in minutes:seconds
	*Fixed sampler note off bug - now a note off command only affects voices
	 assigned to that track
	*Fixed New Machine refresh bug


	V1.1b1
	------

	*Machine muting now works, a muted machine is indicated by the red light
	 being lit
	*Loads and saves the 1.0x file format, although I had to bend over backwards
	 to support this! The file format WILL change...
	*Ticks Per Beat implemented - even compatible with the old file format :)
	*Added "Refresh" button to New Machine dialog - now you can add plugins
	 without restarting :)
	*Sampler polyphony is now per-machine rather than per-track. When a track
	 is loaded and the polyphony is less than 4, it is automatically set to 8.
	*INSERT moves pattern data down and CTRL+DELETE move patterndata up
	*VST dialogs & host totally redesigned - you now create VST plug-ins the same
	 way as native plug-ins, and all configuration is accessed by double-clicking on
	 the machine. One VST machine means one VST plugin instance.
	*Changed configuration dialog to include default directories for Songs, Instruments
	 Native and VST Plug-ins
	*All configuration now stored in the registry except skins, which aren't saved at all
	 (yet)
	*MASSIVE internal recoding
