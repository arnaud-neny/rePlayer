4.3.1 - October 27, 2000
- Now supports FreeBSD (and probably other BSDs using OSS as well).
  Thanks to Bryan Ogawa for the patch!
- Fixed some cosmetic problems, added 4.3's new switches to the
  online help.  

4.3 - October 7, 2000
- Added -v (version) option to show the versions of all the 
  song file format modules.
- Added -o (old-style effects) option for the MT driver.  It's
  hackishly implemented and not how I want to handle it, but
  it'll have to do for now.  This fixes LeCube :-)

4.2a - May 8, 2000
Ian Schmidt
- Removed ModPlug's DSP effects.  They weren't working anyway, and 
  I must clean up MTPng's architecture more before I throw in 
  silly candy :-)

4.2 - March 25, 2000
Ian Schmidt

- Input filetypes are now C++-style objects.  This makes it much easier
  to add support for new filetypes to MTPng.
- Added noise reduction from new GPL version of ModPlug Player.
- Partially integrated bass expansion (not working yet) from same source.
- Added partial support for Will Harvey modified SMUS music, as used in
  Zany Golf and The Immortal.  If you'd like to play with this driver,
  you'll need the inst* and .smu files from either ZG or The Immortal.
  For Zany Golf the only song that will play at all right now is the
  title (MARQUEE.SMU).  The others are compressed.  The Immortal's
  songs are not compressed, and you'll get recognizable playback on
  several of them.  I'll put up easy(er) to use .zips with these
  songs once playback is correct.

4.1 - February 15, 2000
Ian Schmidt
- Fixed SS/MTvibrato effect to work properly (Unforgiven, Freewill)
- Fixed problems with LinuxPPC "dmasound" driver.  This also effects some
  other Linux versions - if you have a non-x86 Linux and MTPng works now,
  please email me so I can update the documentation.

4.0 - January 8, 2000
Ian Schmidt
- Corrected operation of STP command (BW.SONG from the FTA Xmas Demo)
- Fixed tone portamento effect for SS/MT (Teen.Spirit, Freewill)
- Fixed arpeggiato effect for SS/MT (Dugger, Jungle.2).  Now this effect
  should be 100% correct vs. the IIgs (in the closed-source old MTP
  codebase it had some inaccuracies)

4.0a10 - January 2, 2000
Ian Schmidt
- Added newly re-coded NoiseTracker GS 1.x module support
- Cleaned up some things so the filetype modules no longer go meddling in
  oss.c's internal instrument record structure.
- Added tabprot.h with prototypes for the tables in tables.h (which can
  only be included once and should be turned into a .c file).
- Minor cleanups elsewhere

4.0a9 - December 24, 1999
Ian Schmidt
- Fixed errors with big-endian architectures (thanks to Chris Shepherd for 
  letting me telnet into his Power Mac G3 running LinuxPPC and futz
  around).  
- Audio output driver now attempts to work on OSS drivers that don't
  support sample position readback (the LinuxPPC driver in particular
  doesn't, which really sucks).
