* Must make it so individual drivers can have custom commandline switches.
  -o handling currently is junky and suboptimal.
* Split oss.c into OSS-specific and independant parts.  The mixer itself is 
  fully portable.  This will make it easier to create the XMMS and WinAMP
  plugins from the same codebase.
* New Win32 command line, WinAMP, and XMMS versions.
* Win32 can have multiple format drivers - DX software, DX hardware, WaveOut.
* GUI (likely either Qt/KDE or GTK/GNOME based)

* Other IIgs formats.

  I have information for the following formats not in this release of MTP:

  - synthLAB
  - Will Harvey's modified SMUS (used in Zany Golf and The Immortal.  On ZG 
    all songs except the main title are compressed somehow - has anyone
    ever figured this scheme out?).
  - Sierra modified MIDI (used in all Sierra IIgs games including Leisure Suit 
    Larry, King's Quest, Thexder, and Silpheed.)  The format is actually almost 
    identical to the one used in Sierra's later SCI games although no games of 
    that type ever shipped for the IIgs.

  I would like information on these formats if anyone knows anything:
  - Music Studio (I believe some information on this did exist as there were 
    some French music disks using this format with a custom player).
  - Music Construction Set
  - Cinemaware (used in Rocket Ranger, 3 Stooges, Defender of the Crown, and 
    others).
  - "Noise Blaster 2" (used by FTA for Nucleus and Photonix).
  - Any other IIgs formats anyone knows about.
