# rePlayer (another multi-formats music player)

- add the replay selection for each extension in the global settings
- add source browser (directly browse from websites in the same way as https://www.wothke.ch/playmod/) and import from selected songs
- replace replays "displaySettings" with a generic settings system without UI (ui is in replayer instead), to remove dependencies to imgui
- add a project to make rePlayer as a lib/dll (so people can use the replays too): rePlayback (stripped from database and ui)
- import from files: support for songs with multiple files (perfect import?)
- improve the seemless playback (re-use the sample player with multiple replays? as soon as they are compatible: same sample rate)
- mp3: sync info (bitrate) with playback
- database: add album database
- modland: source validation (check for removed files)
- mod archive: source validation (some song ids are redirected to other ids: "emax are you stupid" 92256 to 67566)
- source: don't load on start, just at access (to save memory)
- support for .cue, .m3u, .pls
- pure database random play (System::Mode::Random)
- duplicates finder (https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta https://github.com/ilanschnell/bsdiff4 https://github.com/sisong/HDiffPatch)
